Resurrecting microRNA Ontology http://www.obofoundry.org/ontology/mirnao.html formerly on Google Code

Verified that this is the same version as on BioPortal https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/MIRNAO, versions 1.5-1.7 (all same)
releases directory has versions 1.0 - 1.6 as downloaded from BioPortal.

Papers:

- [Non-coding RNA gene families in the genomes of anopheline mosquitoes](https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-15-1038)
- [miRNAO: An Ontology for microRNAs](http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-897/poster_5.pdf)

Used to be at http://anobase.vectorbase.org/mirnao/mirnao.owl (no response)

Anobase was a precursor to [VectorBase](https://www.vectorbase.org)

This archeology done in support of [NCRO](http://www.obofoundry.org/ontology/ncro.html) after I noted that the purl http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/mirnao.owl no longer resolved, still pointing to the old google code project.

The Vicky Dritsou (vdritsou@gmail.com) was the committer for these versions according to https://code.google.com/archive/p/mirna-ontology/source/default/commits
